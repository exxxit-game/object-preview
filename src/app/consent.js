// when chosen and only from 18), on the clipboard sheet, one page after another: a page
// crowded with text leaves no room for its buttons. Pages: what this is and how to leave; the
// room's own notes (extra, one page each); the age; what recording means, with the two choices.
// The age is asked, not stated: a sentence checks nothing (Steed et al. 2016 asked it; the BPS
// guidance for internet research sends a "no" to a page of its own with no way back): under 18
// the game starts without recording. Resolves with true when the player chose to start with
// recording, false otherwise. sheet: an engine/ui/sheet instance.
// The form is signed by hand, as on paper: the name and the signature, drawn with the laser or the
// mouse, stay in this browser only (privacy.html) and are never sent or logged. Once signed, the lab
// presses its seal by the signature; the seal is as large as its ring's letters need to be read
// (large print, docs/decisions.md), so the date, the signature and the seal take a page of their own.
// Which consent text a result was given under, sent with every result: the controller "shall be able to
// demonstrate that the data subject has consented" (GDPR Art 7(1)), and with anonymous rows the text is
// the only proof (docs/research/revision-2-data.md, D1). Raised whenever the consent's words change
// (APP_T.consent, APP_T.playtest.consent): tests/results.test.mjs holds each version's words.
